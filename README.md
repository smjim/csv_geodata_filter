# csv geodata filter

 - filters geodata stored in csv filetypes by their haversine distance from a given coordinate
 - edit coords, radius, datafile in script and run

## possible future expansions:

 - instead of only selecting points within radius of a given point, select points within radius of a given path (or google maps route), to narrow down candidates for visitation on a roadtrip
